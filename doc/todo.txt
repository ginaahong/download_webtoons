- README.md to .rst (restructuredtext)
    - look into Sphynx? Docsutil?
- requirements.txt
    - to list all packages needed
- reduce num of packages
    - imageio (not needed, can just use shutil)
        - gets rid of numpy and pillow
    - consider using Requests instead of seleinum for entire proj
- /test
    - consider making tests...
    - consider python tool: py.test
- flake8 and style checking? --> I think this is my atom default?
